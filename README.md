## Design  
### Colour Scheme
+ I chose to use a light pink and green and brown for the yoga studios colour scheme. I feel this will give it an earthy healthy vibe
+ According to my research these colors are often used on yoga websites
+ I wanted to use the color green to promote a healthy feel to the site
### Typography
+ I used Poppins as the main font.
+ ## WireFrame
I used the Balsamic website to create the wireframe for the yogaworld website. Having decided on the Strategy, Scope and Structure planes, I set about planning its Skeleton and what would become my vision of the Surface Plane.
